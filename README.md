Simple and lightweight application written in C++ for playing *OggOPUS* files. This is only can parse OGGOpus files, in future it may read OPUS data from other formats too.

#### Key features ðŸŒŸ
- Cross platform (with PortAudio).
- File globbing (only on UNIX).
- Very very lightweight.

## Installation

> This is the \*nix style of building the application from the source. If you're looking for the Windows way to build this, head to the
[`win32`](../../tree/win32) branch for that (MSVC toolchain and Visual Studio are required).
>
> All the libraries and DLLs are prebuilt for windows for the Win32 target (works for most processors supported by Windows), this reduces
> the fuss of linking libraries and DLLs.
> All the binaries and DLLs go to the `bin` directory.
