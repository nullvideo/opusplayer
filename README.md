<p align=center><i>Simple and lightweight application written in C++ for playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_(audio_format)">Ogg OPUS</a> files. This is only can parse OGG Opus files, in future it may read OPUS codec data from other formats too (e.g mka).</i></p>

#### Dependency Tree ðŸ“œ
Make sure that these dependencies are avialable in the environment youâ€™re going to compile it,
on GNU/Linux itâ€™s quite easy to install using a package manager. [`win32`](../../tree/win32) branch already includes
a complete setup. On, MinGW/Cygwin you need to do this manually.

#### Key features ðŸŒŸ
- Cross platform (with PortAudio).
- File globbing (only on UNIX).<br/>
  <sup>queue multiple files at once for playback, like a playlist (e.g `*.opus` selects all of the OPUS files in the current directory).</sup>
- Very very lightweight.

### Installation

> This is the \*nix style of building the application from the source. If you're looking for the Windows way to build this, head to the
[`win32`](../../tree/win32) branch for that (MSVC toolchain and Visual Studio are required).
>
> All the libraries and DLLs are prebuilt for windows for the Win32 target (works for most processors supported by Windows), this reduces
> the fuss of linking libraries and DLLs.
> All the binaries and DLLs go to the `bin` directory.

This is the most traditional way to build up from source in \*NIX based systems:
```sh
make build
sudo make install
make clean # optional: cleanup isn't required unless cleaning mess
```
